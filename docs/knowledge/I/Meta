Deployments Update: Fixes Inbound! 🚀

I've pushed two critical fixes:

Backend Fix: Added a "Welcome" message to the root URL / so it stops saying "Cannot GET /" and confirms it's alive.
Frontend CSP Fix: Relaxed security rules to allow styling to load correctly.
CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Fix the 404 on Frontend
The 404 error on app.gaugon.com is happening because Render is looking in the wrong folder. You MUST change this setting manually:

Go to Render Dashboard -> gaugon-portal (Static Site).
Click Settings -> Scroll down to Build & Deploy.
Find Publish Directory.
Change it to: out
Click Save Changes.
Why? Next.js "Static Export" puts all files in a folder named out. Render doesn't know this by default.

Once you save, Render will auto-deploy. After that finishes, https://app.gaugon.com/portal/login WILL work.

Let me know when you've done this!
