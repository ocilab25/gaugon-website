# Session Summary: Landing Page Critique & Strategy
**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Topic:** Landing Page Optimization (app.gaugon.com)
**Status:** Analysis Complete / Pending User Input for Rewrite

## Key Technical & Strategic Decisions
- **Terminology Shift:** Identified "Audit" as a high-friction term that likely reduces conversion. Suggested softer alternatives like "Roadmap Call" or "Workflow Review".
- **Trust Signals:** Noted a critical lack of specific proof (client names, exact numbers). "Trust" is currently inferred rather than observed.
- **Message Clarity:** The "Process" section (5 steps) was deemed too heavy/slow for a managed service. Needs to feel more "done-for-you".
- **Headline Strategy:** The current headline "Make Your Team Feel 2x Bigger" is conceptually good but too abstract. Needs to be more concrete.

## Action Items & Unfinished Tasks
**Immediate Next Steps (Blocked on User Input):**
The rewrite cannot proceed until the following are defined:
1.  **Exact Outcome:** What is delivered in 7-14 days?
2.  **Anti-Persona:** Who is a bad fit?
3.  **Scope:** What is explicitly included vs. excluded?
4.  **Proof:** Specific stats/stories available *today*.
5.  **Micro-Commitment:** The smallest useful step (replacing "Audit").
6.  **Top Objection:** The #1 reason people say no.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Rewrite Hero section (3 options).
- Draft 3 concrete benefit bullets.
- Create 5 CTA button options.
- Write 5 FAQ items handling objections.
- Reorganize page structure (skeleton).

## Modified Files
*No codebase files were modified in this session.*
- Internal Task Tracking: `task.md` (Updated analysis status).

## Lessons Learned
- **Banned Vocabulary:** Ensure future copy avoids: "game changer", "revolutionize", "dive in", "empowers", "transform".
- **Tone:** Keep it "calm, helpful, direct, no hype".
