# Session Summary: Git Command Fix
**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Topic:** Fixing PowerShell Git Command Error

## Summary
Addressed a PowerShell error during git operations where the command `& 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe' status` failed with "Unexpected token 'status'". The issue was caused by an HTML entity encoding error (`&amp;` instead of `&`) in the command generated by the IDE extension, likely because it was falling back to a full path invocation since `git` was not in the system PATH.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Diagnosis:** Identified that the command failure was due to proper `&` (call operator) usage being corrupted into `&amp;` by the calling tool/extension. This only occurred because the extension was trying to use the full path to `git.exe` rather than the simple `git` command.
- **Solution:** Instead of debugging the extension's string generation, we added `C:\Program Files\Git\bin` to the user's `PATH` environment variable.
- **Outcome:** This allows the system to call `git` directly, bypassing the need for the complex call operator syntax that was getting corrupted.

## Modified File Paths
No repository files were modified. The change was applied to the user's **System Environment Variables**.

## Known Bugs / Unfinished Tasks
- **Action Required:** The user must **restart VS Code** for the updated `PATH` environment variable to be recognized by the editor and its extensions. Until then, the error may persist.

## Lessons Learned
- **Environment Configuration:** Ensuring core tools like Git are in the system `PATH` prevents IDE extensions from resorting to complex, potentially fragile command constructions (like full paths with call operators).
- **PowerShell Parsing:** PowerShell is sensitive to HTML entity encoding in generated commands; `&amp;` is not a valid operator substitute for `&`.
