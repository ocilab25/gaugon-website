We don't rip-and-replace. Everything we suggest is small, reversible, and uses the tools you already have. If a change feels risky, we flag it and let you decide."},{question:"I don't have time to redo my systems right now.",answer:"You don't have to. We do the mapping and write the plan. You can run it yourself when you're ready, hand it to your next hire, or ask us to help execute later. It's designed to fit your timeline, not ours."},{question:"What if I don't want to give you access to my tools?",answer:"No problem. We can work read-only, or you can just screen-share and walk us through. Some quick wins require access, but the roadmap doesn't."},{question:"How is this different from hiring a Zapier consultant or a freelance VA?",answer:"We're not just wiring tools together. We review your security/privacy setup, spot bottlenecks in how your team actually works, and give you a written plan ranked by business impact—not just what's technically easy. And we're upfront about what not to automate."},{question:"What happens after the 7–14 days?",answer:"You get a full report and a ranked action plan. You can run it yourself, hire someone else to execute, or stick with us on a monthly plan if you want ongoing help. No lock-in, no recurring unless you want it."},{question:"What types of businesses can benefit from automation?",answer:"Any business with repetitive tasks or high volumes of customer interaction. Common fits include e-commerce, SaaS, agencies, and professional services."},{question:"How long does it take to implement automation?",answer:"Simple workflows usually take 1–2 weeks. More complex projects typically take 4–8 weeks. We'll give you a clear timeline after the audit."},{question:"Will this require changes to our existing systems?",answer:"We build around what you already use. Most integrations are non-disruptive and work with your current stack."},{question:"What kind of support do you provide?",answer:"All plans include email support. Growth and Scale plans add priority response times and regular check-ins. We also provide training materials and documentation."},{question:"How do you measure success?",answer:"We set clear goals during the audit—things like time saved, error reduction, or faster response times. You'll see ongoing metrics through dashboards and regular reports."},{question:"Can automation scale as we grow?",answer:"Yes. We design for growth. As your business expands, we add new workflows, connect more systems, and optimize what's already running."}].map((s,r)=>(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden",children:[(0,a.jsxs)("button",{onClick:()=>t(e===r?null:r),className:"w-full px-6 py-5 text-left flex justify-between items-center hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors",children:[a.jsx("span",{className:"font-semibold text-gray-900 pr-8",children:s.question}),a.jsx("svg",{className:`w-5 h-5 text-gray-500 flex-shrink-0 transition-transform ${e===r?"rotate-180":""}`,fill:"none",stroke:"currentColor",viewBox:"0 0 24 24",children:a.jsx("path",{strokeLinecap:"round",strokeLinejoin:"round",strokeWidth:2,d:"M19 9l-7 7-7-7"})})]}),e===r&&a.jsx("div",{className:"px-6 pb-5 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed",children:s.answer})]},r))})})})]})}},4192:(e,t,s)=>{"use strict";s.r(t),s.d(t,{default:()=>a});let a=(0,s(8570).createProxy)(String.raw`/home/krisa/Documents/GitHub/gaugon-website/app/faq/page.tsx#default`)}};var t=require("../../webpack-runtime.js");t.C(e);var s=e=>t(t.s=e),a=t.X(0,[703,695],()=>s(252));module.exports=a})();
